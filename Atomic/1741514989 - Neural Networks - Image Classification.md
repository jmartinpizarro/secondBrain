# Neural Networks - Image Classification

## Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN

Instead of preprocessing the data to derive features such as shapes, a CNN takes just the image's raw pixel data as input and "learns" how to extract these features, and ultimately infer what object they constitute.

For doing so, it uses the [[1741515078 - Convolution|Convolution]] process.
